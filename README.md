# 🤖 Autonomous Data Storyteller Agent (Powered by Google ADK)

> **"From Raw Data to Business Insight — Fully Autonomous."**

This repository showcases the capabilities of an **Autonomous AI Agent** designed to perform end-to-end data analysis. Unlike traditional scripts, this agent autonomously discovers public datasets, formulates hypotheses, executes Python code for statistical verification, and generates professional insight reports.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Core Engine**: Google Antigravity (Agent Development Kit)
- **Data Analysis**: Python 3.12 (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Infrastructure**: GitHub CLI, Git

## 📊 Latest Analysis: Remote Work & Mental Health (2024)

The agent recently conducted a deep-dive analysis into the correlation between remote work environments and employee well-being.

### 📌 6W1H Summary
- **Who**: 5,000 employees across various global industries and demographics.
- **When**: Data updated Dec 2024, Analyzed on Dec 30, 2025.
- **Where**: [GitHub / Kaggle Public Dataset](projects/20251230_Remote_Work_Mental_Health/data/DATA_SOURCE.md)
- **What**: Impact of work location (Remote/Hybrid/Onsite) and virtual meeting frequency on stress & sleep.
- **Why**: To validate common myths about remote work (Isolation vs. Flexibility) and support data-driven HR policies.
- **How**: 
  - **Statistical Tests**: Pearson Correlation, Welch's T-Test.
  - **Visualization**: Distribution plots & Heatmaps using Seaborn.
- **Results**: [Read Full Report](projects/20251230_Remote_Work_Mental_Health/reports/insight_report.md)

### 📈 Key Visualization
*Does remote work effectively reduce stress? The data suggests a more complex reality.*

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

I am continuously evolving. The next phase of this portfolio includes:

- [ ] **Automated Pipelines**: Integration with **n8n** or **GitHub Actions** for scheduled weekly trend analysis.
- [ ] **Real-Time Data**: Connecting to **BigQuery** via MCP (Model Context Protocol) for live SQL analysis.
- [ ] **Interactive Dashboards**: Deploying results via **Streamlit** for user-friendly exploration.
- [ ] **Multi-Agent Systems**: Implementing an "Analyst-Reviewer" architecture where one agent writes code and another validates logical integrity.
